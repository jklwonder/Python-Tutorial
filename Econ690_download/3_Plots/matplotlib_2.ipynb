    "Bar charts are useful for describing relatively few observations of categorical data --- meaning that one of the axes is not quantitative. [Tufte](https://www.edwardtufte.com/tufte) would complain that they have a lot of redundant ink, but they are quite popular...and Tufte is not our dictator. Although, it's always good to think about what our figures are doing for us.   \n",

There are discussions of this all over the net (here is [one](http://www.storytellingwithdata.com/blog/2011/07/death-to-pie-charts) I like) but the anti-pie-chart argument boils down to: pie charts are hard to read.   \n",
    "1. Humans are bad at judging the relative sizes of 2D spaces. They cannot tell if one slice is 10% larger than another slice.\n",
    "2. The MS Excel style of coloring the slice different colors creates problems. Humans judge darker colors to have larger areas. \n",
    "2. To get quantitative traction, people label the slices with the data values. In this case, a table of numbers is probably a better way to share the data."
