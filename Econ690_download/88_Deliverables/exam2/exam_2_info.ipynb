    "* Go over the coding practices. \n",
    "* You could try doing the practice parts from the class notebooks and the coding practice problems again, but without much outside help. Are there subjects that need more practice?\n",
    "* Take the practice exam as if it was a real exam. Keep track of time, and do not discuss the exam with others. Again, did you find subjects that could use more practice?"
