    "1. I used the `figsize` parameter to subplot. This is a tuple of figure width and height in inches. (Inches! Take that rest of the world!) The height and width are of the **printed** figure. You will notice that jupyter notebook scaled it down for display. This is useful when you are preparing graphics for a publication and you need to meet an exact figure size. \n",
    "2. I made the line color a variable, so it is easy to change all the line colors at one. For example, I like red figures when I am giving presentations, but black figures when I am creating pdfs that will be printed out on a black and white printer."
